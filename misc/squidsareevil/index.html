When playing back inputs, if you kill a mob (preferably a squid) and it drops a different item than it did when recording your inputs, then you are bound to run into some problems&mldr;</p><p>Just like you can enter a seed for a Minecraft world, you can theoretically enter a seed for every randomnes happening in the game, making everything deterministic.</p><p>The game has lots of different random instances, all requiring having a different seed and the early attempts at solving this, was throwing out every randomness and have everything depend on only one instance, that we can control.</p><p>So everything in the entire game had the same seed, making it theoretically deterministic.</p><p>But for some reason, the seed kept changing, even though it was not supposed to.<br>After a long search we found the error in the files for the squid.</p><p>Turns out, the squid actually <em>sets the seed</em> when it spawns&mldr; No other creature in the game does that.</p><p>Here is my theory on why Mojang added that:</p><p>Squids usually spawn in clusters at the same time. Due to how RNG works, everything that spawns in the same millisecond has the same seed.<br>This makes all squids in the newly spawned cluster swim into the same direction, making it look very weird.<br>As a quick fix, Mojang decided to set the seed of the squid manually, so they would all swim in different directions.</p><p>And for the more technical readers:<br>Squids in 1.12.2 set their entityseed in the constructor to 1 plus their entityid, which is counted up everytime an entity is created, essentially creating a seed for every squid. The rotation of the squid is set directly after that, which also leads me to my theory</p><p>Being mad at squids, Scribble declared them as evil, which is now an easter egg and the inspiration behind <a href=https://github.com/ScribbleLP/KillTheRNG target=_blank>KillTheRNG</a> to fix exactly that problem and much much more.</p></article></section><footer><p>This website shouldn't use any cookies! ‚ùåüç™‚ùå</p><p class=centerTextalign><br>Website contributions by Scribble, Unease and Pancake</p></footer></div></body></html>
