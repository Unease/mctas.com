			<p>Here, we aim to beat Minecraft in the fastest way possible by using tools!
				<br> To get started, check out the <a href="/tutorials/">Tutorials</a> section.
				<br> Btw, we are not affiliated with Mojang in any way, this is an unofficial "Minecraft" site.

			<p>Still confused? Maybe check out these TASes! (If you watch them, you will get some cookies, be warned!)

			<h3>Any% Glitched in ~20 seconds</h3>

			<h3>All Advancements (1.12.2) Glitched in 00:12:25.0</h3>
			<p>Played in 1.12.2 since this was the first version to have advancements (In 1.11 they were called
