Later in video editing, you speed up the footage from slow motion to normal speed.
The result is a video in normal speed, but the player has better reaction times.
Additionally you may use savestates, which is the ability to create a restore point at any time during your run and if you fail at something, you can reload the savestate to try again.</description></item><item><title>Playback</title><link>https://test.minecrafttas.com/tutorials/playback/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://test.minecrafttas.com/tutorials/playback/</guid><description>What are playback TASes? Most TASes that you will see are made using some form of playback using an emulator with an option called movie playback which allows you to directly playback your TASes in real time.
Playback of these movies require no external tampering (e.g hacks/cheats), to run properly as it is the emulator/console reading a series of inputs from an input file like a player piano.
What are the benefits of playback TASing?</description></item><item><title>Tools</title><link>https://test.minecrafttas.com/tutorials/tools/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://test.minecrafttas.com/tutorials/tools/</guid><description>Here is a list of commonly used tools in Minecraft TASing&amp;hellip; While you may recognise some of these tools from emulator TASing, the implementation in Minecraft is most likely completely different.
Tickratechanger This is the name of the module used to slow down or speed up the game speed. As many games, Minecraft runs on a tick based system, which is different to for example SM64, which runs on a frame based system&amp;hellip;</description></item><item><title>Setup with Minecraft Launcher</title><link>https://test.minecrafttas.com/tutorials/installation/setup_mclauncher/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://test.minecrafttas.com/tutorials/installation/setup_mclauncher/</guid><description>MC version 1.14+ (For versions below 1.14 click here) We use the Fabric modloader for mods in 1.14+
Installing Fabric Download the installer from FabricMC. (Only download from this website!)

We suggest checking out the official Website
The main differences is that you can create multiple &amp;ldquo;instances&amp;rdquo; or minecraft, each with their own .minecraft/ folder. This means each instance can have a completely different minecraft installation, be it a different version, forge, fabric, different mods as opposed to only one mods folder in the vanilla launcher.</description></item><item><title>Java Setup</title><link>https://test.minecrafttas.com/tutorials/installation/setup_java/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://test.minecrafttas.com/tutorials/installation/setup_java/</guid><description>Some Minecraft versions require different Java versions to run and for applications like MultiMC, you need to install java yourself.
By the time of writing this, Minecraft 1.18.2 is the latest version and the latest Java version is Java 18 (which is like a month old&amp;hellip; I will still use 17 for now)
Some things to point out:
The java requirements are: Minecraft up to 1.12.2 requires Java 8.

If you still think these creatures are harmless and don&amp;rsquo;t want to hurt you, here is some advice for you:
In Minecraft TASing, we have to deal a lot with the randomness of the game. When playing back inputs, if you kill a mob (preferably a squid) and it drops a different item than it did when recording your inputs, then you are bound to run into some problems&amp;hellip;</description></item><item><title>Server Icon</title><link>https://test.minecrafttas.com/misc/history-corner/server-icon/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://test.minecrafttas.com/misc/history-corner/server-icon/</guid><description>written by Scribble
There has been quite a few changes to our server icon, each with an interesting history!
Creation of the current icon The beginning Back when there was only an MT as the &amp;ldquo;server icon&amp;rdquo;, we struggeled to find a fitting icon for Minecraft TASing: Having a clock as an icon wasn&amp;rsquo;t actually a bad idea, however &amp;ldquo;only&amp;rdquo; a clock seemed a bit lame to me.
2 days after I created the server, I was invited to a CTM-Speedrunning Discord (which you can find in Discords), which had the following server icon: I took some inspiration from that and in a few minutes I created this: After presenting the idea, Pesud came up with the following:</description></item></channel></rss>
