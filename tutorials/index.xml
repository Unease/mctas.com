Later in video editing, you speed up the footage from slow motion to normal speed.
The result is a video in normal speed, but the player has better reaction times.
Additionally you may use savestates, which is the ability to create a restore point at any time during your run and if you fail at something, you can reload the savestate to try again.</description></item><item><title>Playback</title><link>https://test.minecrafttas.com/tutorials/playback/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://test.minecrafttas.com/tutorials/playback/</guid><description>What are playback TASes? Most TASes that you will see are made using some form of playback using an emulator with an option called movie playback which allows you to directly playback your TASes in real time.
Playback of these movies require no external tampering (e.g hacks/cheats), to run properly as it is the emulator/console reading a series of inputs from an input file like a player piano.
What are the benefits of playback TASing?</description></item><item><title>Tools</title><link>https://test.minecrafttas.com/tutorials/tools/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://test.minecrafttas.com/tutorials/tools/</guid><description>Here is a list of commonly used tools in Minecraft TASing&amp;hellip; While you may recognise some of these tools from emulator TASing, the implementation in Minecraft is most likely completely different.
Tickratechanger This is the name of the module used to slow down or speed up the game speed. As many games, Minecraft runs on a tick based system, which is different to for example SM64, which runs on a frame based system&amp;hellip;</description></item></channel></rss>
