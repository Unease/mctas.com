You may also argue that this is not a real form of TASing at all. However, there are several reasons why we may prefer to use non-playback.</p><h3 id=1-it-is-easier-and-quicker-to-make>1. It is easier and quicker to make</h3><p>Playback TASing requires way more time and effort than non-playback. Longer TASes take months or even years to complete.</p><h3 id=2-the-tools-for-playback-are-not-there-yet>2. The tools for playback are not there yet</h3><p>Tool development is extremely time consuming, especially with Minecraft mods. Using existing tools like <a href=https://tasvideos.org/EmulatorResources/LibTAS target=_blank>libTAS</a> proved to <a href=https://github.com/clementgallet/libTAS/issues/47 target=_blank>not work on Minecraft Java Edition</a>.</p><p>For that reason we are using Minecraft mods to implement the tools.<br>And writing non-playback tools is also easier than writing playback tools.</p><h3 id=3-rng>3. RNG</h3><p>Minecraft is really indeterministic. If you start an instance of Minecraft the RNG is already random, since it is based on system time in nanoseconds. In theory, you can make it deterministic if you have nanosecond precision, which is basically impossible in reality.</p><p>And playing the game yourself lets you react to RNG much easier.</p><p>RNG is why playback is much harder to implement into Minecraft due to the fact it is near impossible to manipulate it. Many playback TASes often manipulate luck in their runs so they can have the best outcomes possible.</p><p>However, since we cannot manipulate Minecraft RNG easily, most playback TASes would desync, which is why almost every Minecraft TAS uses non-playback.</p><h2 id=the-downside>The downside</h2><ul><li>Non-playback is not as precise as playback TASing</li><li>Not as accurate to the vanilla game</li><li>Requires editing knowledge</li><li>TASing has to be in video form</li><li>Difficult for multiple people to collaborate on one TAS</li></ul><h2 id=for-downloading-non-playback-tools-go-to-downloadsdownloads>For downloading non-playback tools, go to <a href=/downloads/>Downloads</a>.</h2></article></section><footer><p>This website shouldn't use any cookies! ‚ùåüç™‚ùå</p><p class=centerTextalign><br>Website contributions by Scribble, Unease and Pancake</p></footer></div></body></html>
