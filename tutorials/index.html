			<h1>Tutorials</h1>
			<h2>Tool-Assisted Speedrunning</h2>
			<p>A TAS is a speedrun created or aided by tools that aims to achieve the fastest time possible.<br> This
				works by recording or manually entering inputs that get sent to the emulated game on playback. This is
				similar to playing a piano, you
				can play it by yourself and may make mistakes, while a <a
					href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aseMAEctM1s&t=15s" target=_blank>player piano</a> can play
				perfectly every time.
				<br> Note that TASes are not created to compete against real-time runners and thus are not accepted on
				real-time speedrun leaderboards. The main hub for TASes is <a href="http://tasvideos.org"
					target=_blank>TASVideos.org</a> where you can also find more
				tools for other games.
				<br> The tools range from slowdown/frame advance to savestates and RAM-watch. An explaination in video
				form can also be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ietk1-Wb7oY" target=_blank>here</a>.
			</p>

			<h2><i>Minecraft</i> Tool-Assisted Speedrunning</h2>
			<p>Minecraft Java Edition is different to the usual games that are TASed, since it is not running on a
				console games are TASed using an emulator and will then verified on a real console. Minecraft doesn't
				have an emulator, but we can modify the
				game to get a similar result to emulators.
			</p>

			<h2>Type</h2>
			<p>Over the years 2 types of tutorials emerged. <i>Playback</i> TASing is the act of recording keyboard and
				mouse inputs, and playing them back. This is the type that is usually associated with TASing in other
				games, played with an emulator.
				<br>
				<br>
				<i>Non-Playback</i> TASing emerged as an easier to learn alternative, that is less optimized than
				Playback TASing. Plus there is still a lack of tools regarding Playback TASing, so long story short:
				start with Non-Playback.
