TAS Battles is a type of PVP. It uses mods to play various gamemodes in slow motion. Originally we used the same mods as we use for Tool-Assisted Speedrunning, which is why we call it "TAS"-Battle even tho it has nothing to do with speedrunning.  
  
Setting up a server can be really difficult, so we have set up a server for you.
