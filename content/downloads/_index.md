## Important!

*   Our mods are most of the times still in development
*   They may be more incompatible with other mods, since this was not our focus when creating them
*   We went to great effort to add nothing that is impossible to do in vanilla, but due to the nature of *some* modloaders, things may not be 100% vanilla.  
    **So remember: Even if the mod allows your actions like spawn manipulation, it doesn't mean that it is strictly allowed in TASing**
