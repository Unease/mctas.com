MultiMC is an open source Minecraft launcher with additional functionalities compared to the [vanilla launcher]({{<ref "/tutorials/installation/setup_mclauncher">}})
  
We suggest checking out the {{<newtablink "official Website" "https://multimc.org">}}

The main differences is that you can create multiple "instances" or minecraft, each with their own .minecraft/ folder.
This means each instance can have a completely different minecraft installation, be it a different version, forge, fabric, different mods as opposed to only one mods folder in the vanilla launcher.  
  
## Prerequisites
A downside is, that MultiMC doesn't include java like the vanilla launcher. This means **you have to install java yourself!**.  
If you plan on using 1.8-1.12.2 and 1.14+ versions you also need to install multiple java versions. A full guide can be found {{<newtablink "here" "../setup_java">}}

## Downloading and installing MultiMC
1. Download MultiMC from {{<newtablink "MultiMC.org" "https://multimc.org/#Download">}}
2. Extract the zip to a folder of your choice
3. In the extracted folder you'll find a "MultiMC.exe", run that
4. Select your language

5. Next, select the java installation. If you have nothing here, check {{<newtablink "here" "../setup_java">}}  
{{<figure class="screenshot" src="MultiMC_wZu08AygSk.png">}}
6. At the bottom you can allocate more memory to Minecraft. 2 GB is usually enough, 4 GB for extreme uses (Playing modpacks).  
7. Accept or deny the analytics and click "Finish"

## Adding mods
