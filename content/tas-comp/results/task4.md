Burnout%  
Task: Make a redstone torch reach the burnout state  
  
Version: 1.12.2
  
Seed: `-8599623488174955388`  
  
Starting location: 0 79 0. (Should be no teleporting necessary)  
  
Difficulty: Peaceful  
  
Additional Information:  
- Glitchless
- The redstone torch has to be placed on top or on the side of bedrock
- It is a requirement that you play with the TorchBurnout mod uploaded below this message. This will send a chat message once a redstone torch is burned out.
- Time starts on world load without setup.
- Time stops when a burnout notification in chat appears and the torch was placed on bedrock
- Allowed mods: Optifine, LoTAS1.12.2-2.0.0, LoTAS-GamerEdition, TorchBurnout-1.0.
- Do not code your own mods to gain an advantage! This is not a coding competition!
- Resourcepacks are allowed but keep the video watchable...
- Please don't add a timer to your video, I will add one myself anyway... Doesn't mean you are not allowed to time your run and write the time elsewhere
- Remember to keep the raw files in case of a further investigation!

If you have questions about allowed strats dm me @Scribble.  
  
Submit your TAS by DMing a link to @TAS8999 . You can update your submission by dming the bot again. If you submit a meme run, type the link to your submission AND the meme run submission in one message, so the bot updates it with 2 submissions  
  
If you are in a team with someone, only one needs to submit, but include your teammates name in the submission, so we don't forget >_<  
  
Deadline: Friday, 26th of November 2021 9pm (GMT)
  
Good Luck!
