Start a bakery%  
Task: Create all baked goods in Minecraft (cake, cookie, piece of bread, pumpkin pie) without the use of villagers  
Version: 1.12.2  
Start on the world file below  
  
Additional Information:  
- Glitchless! Duping is not allowed, except duping buckets, to make it not too long. You are allowed to dupe either empty buckets or filled buckets.
- It is not allowed to abuse invulnerability frames after joining
- It is not allowed to manipulate the gear of zombies and skeletons (Or any other mob) to get op gear right at the start of the game. However normal zombie or skeleton drops are allowed to be manipulated, such as a carrot from a zombie or an enchanted bow from a skeleton
- The time in the world has been advanced to night time using /tickrate, so chickens have already laid an egg
- Time stops when all items are in your inventory, it needs to be in an inventory slot and not held with the cursor
- Optifine is allowed, even the zoom, but keep it epilepsy friendly (Looking at you Lid)
- Resourcepacks are allowed but keep the video watchable...
- Remember to keep the raw files in case of a further investigation!

If you have questions about allowed strats dm me @Scribble. Same goes for submitting your TAS.  
  
If you are in a team with someone, only one needs to dm me, but tell me the other person you teamed with, so I don't forget >_<

Deadline: Wednesday 9th of December 8pm (GMT)

Good Luck!
