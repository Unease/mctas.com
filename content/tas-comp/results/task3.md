Difficulty: Easy  
  
Additional Information:  
- Glitched
- It is not allowed to manipulate the gear of zombies and skeletons (Or any other mob) to get op gear right at the start of the game. However normal zombie or skeleton drops are allowed to be manipulated, such as a carrot from a zombie or an enchanted bow from a skeleton
- Time starts on world load without setup (e.g. /tp) this is to prevent people waiting until night time before starting the timer
- Time stops when you obtain a stack of lime wool. If it's in your inventory and not in your hotbar, open the inventory to confirm that you obtained it. After that the time will stop
- Allowed mods: Optifine, Optifabric, FabricAPI, Fabric TAS, Jellysquid optimization mods and/or TASTickratechanger-fabric if you want to make it harder for yourself.
Do not code your own mods to gain an advantage! This is not a coding competition!
- Resourcepacks are allowed but keep the video watchable...
- Please don't add a timer to your video, I will add one myself anyway... Doesn't mean you are not allowed to time your run and write the time elsewhere
- Remember to keep the raw files in case of a further investigation!

If you have questions about allowed strats dm me @Scribble. Same goes for submitting your TAS.  
  
If you are in a team with someone, only one needs to dm me, but tell me the other person you teamed with, so I don't forget >_<  
  
Deadline: Friday 19th of March 8pm (GMT)  
  
Good Luck!
