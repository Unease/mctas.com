From now on, any strat leaking will result in disqualification, also do not talk about the tasks outside of tc-general-task1  
Tomb Destroyer%  
Task: Destroy every (colored) terracotta block in and outside a desert temple.  
  
Version: 1.12.2  
  
Seed: `-2579494896997723047`  
  
Additional Information:  
- You don't need to collect the terracotta blocks, just destroy them. 
- It is not allowed to manipulate the gear of zombies and skeletons (Or any other mob) to get op gear right at the start of the game.
- You are not allowed to use commands and general TASing rules apply, that is: If it's not possible in vanilla, it's not allowed in TASing. 
- You may use the duping functionality of TASTools
- Optifine is allowed, even the zoom
- Resourcepacks are allowed but keep the video watchable...
- Remember to keep the raw files in case of a further investigation!
- For simplicity sake please do not look for the best vanilla spawn... Forge always spawns at the same place in vanilla and thats easier to check
  
Deadline: Wednesday 25th of November 8pm (GMT)
