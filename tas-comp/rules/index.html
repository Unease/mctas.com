Not even a hint that you found the best strat ever.</li><li>Do <strong>NOT</strong> leak the task to non participants, bystanders will discuss new strats that participants can use as an advantage.</li><li>You may resubmit a run within the submission period.</li><li>The submission has to follow the task rules to be valid. Organisers may point out rule breaks so you can resubmit a valid run, but don&rsquo;t always count on that.<br>Purposefully breaking the rules and submitting it will count as a meme run, check the special rules for that</li><li>Do <strong>NOT</strong> code your own mods or tools just for this competition. This is not a coding competition and the best tools win.</li><li>Working as a team is allowed, but announce all team members when you participate.<ul><li>You are <strong>not</strong> allowed to play the task in multiplayer on a server</li><li>You are allowed to discuss strats in your team</li><li>Segments from multiple team members stitched together are allowed (e.g. by sharing savestates)</li><li>Only one person has to submit the run, but mention all team members in the submission notes</li></ul></li></ol><p><em>Rulebreakers</em> will be disqualified and may re-join once the next round starts. In severe cases this may lead to a ban from the discord.</p><p><em>Invalid runs</em> will not be qualified for the video in the end, but it will not disqualify you from the competition. Invalid runs may be shown in an &ldquo;All Submissions&rdquo; video if you wish for it to be included.</p><h2 id=additional-infos>Additional Info&rsquo;s</h2><ul><li>Due to the nature of different PC&rsquo;s and different recording capabilities, we may need to call some cases a tie even if times are different and one clearly seems faster&mldr; We want to make it fair for everyone regardless of their PC specs&mldr;</li><li>You may dm Scribble#1216 for questions regarding the task. This will be forwarded to the team. We may announce clarifications publicly to everyone</li></ul><h2 id=editing-and-submitting>Editing and Submitting</h2><ul><li>Currently tasks will be <a href=/tutorials/non-playback/ target=_blank>non playback TASes</a>, so your run has to be edited in some way. You may edit out sections where you are <em>not ingame</em>. This includes the pause menu and the main menu, as well as the loading screens. If you leave in too much, the organisers may remove some sections in your favour.</li><li>Do <strong>NOT</strong> edit a timer into your submission, we organisers will retime and add our own timers anyway&mldr; But you are still allowed to time the run yourself.</li><li>Keep the raw recording files as we may check if time was saved in the edit.</li><li>Upload the submission to a file sharing service of your choice, but we recommend using YouTube. Make sure to set the video to unlisted. After the results are published, we will link to your submission.</li></ul><h2 id=meme-runs>Meme runs</h2><p>Have some creative way to solve the task? Then do what you must do&mldr;</p><p>The only rule here is:</p><ul><li>Submit a real run before submitting a meme run!</li></ul><p>In the past we almost had more meme runs than real submissions, so we want to prevent that&mldr;</p><p>In the submission process, you need to link 2 videos in one message so your meme run gets accepted.</p><p>Sooner or later all meme runs are shown, but only 1 meme run may be chosen for the result video.</p></article></section><footer><p>This website shouldn't use any cookies! ‚ùåüç™‚ùå</p><p class=centerTextalign><br>Website contributions by Scribble, Unease and Pancake</p></footer></div></body></html>
