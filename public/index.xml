      <description>Non-playback TASing The basics Instead of choosing each input per frame and play back the TAS at the end, non-playback TASing is the act of screen recording yourself speedrunning, but setting the game to slow motion.
Later in video editing, you speed up the footage from slow motion to normal speed.
The result is a video in normal speed, but the player has better rection times.
Additionally you may use savestates, which is the ability to create a restore point at any time during your run and if you fail at something, you can reload the savestate to try again.</description>

      <description>Playback TASing What are playback TASes? Most TASes that you will see are made using some form of playback using an emulator with an option called movie playback which allows you to directly playback your TASes in real time.
Playback of these movies require no external tampering (e.g hacks/cheats), to run properly as it is the emulator/console reading a series of inputs from an input file like a player piano.</description>
